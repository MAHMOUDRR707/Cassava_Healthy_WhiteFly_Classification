# Cassava_Healthy_WhiteFly_Classification


Cassava plants got disease by whitefly so making model to guess which plants in specific which has whitefly on it to predict the diseases earlier



Content
Data is collected from internet pics with jpg format (1852 files)

There is two classes :

1- Healthy Cassava which contain 771 files

2- Whitefly Cassava (which will get disease in future ) contain 1081 files




Inspiration
I hope that with this dataset, some machine learning model might achieve better and cheaper prediction than a dermatologist.
Have fun!
